# Dutch word formation from a non-linguistic perspective

Within this project I'm analysing Dutch word formation. It turned out that networks built in R excellently answer many of my, second-language learner of Dutch, questions.

First check out my presentation [http://rpubs.com/JacekPardyak/DWF](http://rpubs.com/JacekPardyak/DWF). 

Then you can play with your "second language" using content of this repository. 

Veel plezier!
