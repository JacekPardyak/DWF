## Outline

- Motivation,

- Dutch word formation - linguistic perspective,

- Graph theory,

- Relation of letter alternation,

- Alternation graph properties,

- Exercises,

- Shiny application.

## Motivation

To communicate you need to learn vocabulary (list of words) and grammar (art of picking and ordering words from vocabulary). Then you can:

- receive messages and process them (listen and read),

- process thoughts and send expressing them messages (write and speak).

Second-language learners of Dutch struggle with phenomena like:

1. kannen - kunnen - kennen - kinnen

2. braken - breken - broeken - breuken

3. morgen - zorgen - worgen - borgen 

## Questions

- How to identify slightly differing words?

- What are central (the most similar to other) Dutch words? 

- How far we can get sequentially altering one letter in a chosen word? And further:

1. From which word to start to pass maximal number of words? 

2. How to decide which word to choose next?

- What is the minimal number of sequential alternations after which we come back to the same word?

- How to find non-words which look and sound like Dutch words?


## Dutch word formation through the eyes of a linguist

The major word formation processes in Dutch are :

1. compounding e.g.: 

- oude-mannen-huis,

- zak-geld & geld-zak,

- arbeids-ongeschiktheids-verzekerings-maatschappij.

2. derivation (affixation and alternation) e.g.:

- woon-t | ge-woon-d | on-ge-woon | won-en,

- Amsterdam-se | Amsterdam-mer | Amsterdam-mers | Amsterdam-mertje,

- sluit-en | sloot | slot | sleut-el.

We focus further only on alternation, regardless of vowel or consonant.

## Definitions

A **graph** (aka network) is a mathematical structure used to model pairwise relations between objects.

Graph is made up of **vertices** (aka nodes or points) which are connected by **edges** (aka arcs, links or lines).

Edges are defined by a **relation** between vertices, e.g. LinkedIn connection, people acquaintance, film co-starring, nominations etc.

**Relation of alternation**: two words *x* and *y* are related ( *x ~ y* ) iff they differ by exactly one letter.

This relation is:

- **not** reflexive (*x ~ x*),

- symmetric (if *x ~ y* then *y ~ x* ), 

- **not** transitive (if *x ~ y* and *y ~ z* then *x ~ z*).

Thus this is **not** an equivalence relation.


## Definitions


Indicators of **centrality** identify the most important vertices within a graph. 

**Degree centrality** is defined as the number of edges incident upon a vertex.

**Closeness centrality** average length of the shortest path between a vertex and all other vertices in the graph. 

**Betweenness centrality** quantifies the number of times a vertex acts as a bridge along the shortest path between two other vertices.

A graph **diameter** is the longest geodesic distance (length of the shortest path between two vertices) in the graph.

**Farthest vertices** are vertices which are connected by the diameter path.

Graph **clique** is a complete (each pair of graph vertices is connected by an edge) sub graph.

**Largest clique** is a clique for which there is no other clique including more vertices.

**Circle** is a path such that the first node of the path corresponds to the last.

**Shortest circle** is a circle or which there is no other circle including less vertices.

## Definitions

- Graph is **connected** when each vertex is reachable from any other vertex.

- **Pseudoword** (aka non-word) is a unit of speech or text that appears to be an actual word in a certain language, while in fact it has no meaning in the lexicon (vocabulary).




```{r}

# non-trivial

```

## Data preparation

1. Data comes from: [www.opentaal.org](www.opentaal.org). We use all "basic-approved", "basic-unapproved" and "inflected" datasets.

2. Proper names (abbreviations, geographical names, first names, nationality names, etc.) are written with small letters.

```{r}
klanken <- data.frame(
  matrix(data = c(
    "au", "A",
    "ei", "B",
    "eu", "C", 
    "ie", "D",
    "ij", "E",
    "oe", "F", 
    "ou", "G",
    "ui", "H"
  ), nrow = 8, byrow = T))
```

3. Pairs from the list (Tweetekenklanken): 

**`r paste(klanken$X1, collapse = ', ')`**

are treated as an one letter.

4. Alternation relation is established thanks to the *base::agrep* function:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
agrep(pattern = word, x = words, value = T,
                 max.distance = list(
                   insertions = 0,
                   deletions = 0,
                   substitutions = 1,
                   cost = 1), useBytes = TRUE)
```


## Graph construction and visualization


5. Graph is constructed with *igraph::graph_from_data_frame* function:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
graph_from_data_frame(d = data_out,
                      directed = FALSE,
                      vertices = NULL)
```

6. Interactive graph visualizations made with  *visNetwork::visNetwork* function:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
visNetwork(nodes = graph$nodes,
           edges = graph$edges)
```


7. Other interactive visualizations made with *plotly::plot_ly* function:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
plot_ly(x = deg,
        type = "histogram",
        histnorm = "probability")
```

8. Dashboard is produces with *shiny* and *shinydashboard* libraries.

## Example of alternation subgraph

```{r}
words <- c("Dank", "je", "wel", "voor", "de", "mooie", "dag")
```


Words in the sentence: **`r paste(words, collapse = " ")`** form sub graph: 


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(visNetwork)
library(igraph)
load("./DWF_data.RData")
words <- tolower(words)

neighbors <- c()
for(word in words){
  x <- match(word, V(net)$name)
  y <- neighborhood(graph = net, nodes = x)[[1]]  
  neighbors <- c(neighbors, y)
}

subNet <- induced_subgraph(graph = net,
                           vids = neighbors,
                           impl =  "copy_and_delete" )
subNet <- toVisNetworkData(igraph = subNet, idToLabel = TRUE)

visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 
```


## Alternation graph vertices

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
V(net)
```

## Alternation graph edges 

```{r}
E(net)
```


## Alternation graph degree centrality

Vertices with the highest degree:

```{r}
deg <- degree(net, mode="all")
deg <- deg[order(deg, decreasing = T)]
head(deg)
```


Vertices with the lowest degree:

```{r}
tail(deg)
```


## The 'mans' word neighborhood (highest degree vertex)

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(visNetwork)

word <- names(deg[1]) # c("Ã ")
node <- match(word, V(net)$name)
neighbors <- neighborhood(graph = net, nodes = node)[[1]]
subNet <- induced_subgraph(graph = net,
                           vids = neighbors,
                           impl =  "copy_and_delete" )
subNet <- toVisNetworkData(igraph = subNet, idToLabel = TRUE)

visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 
```




## Relative frequency of vertex degree

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
p <- plot_ly(x = deg,
             type = "histogram",
             histnorm = "probability")  %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Vertex degree"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Relative frequency"))
p
```

## Dependency between vertex degree and vertex length

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(V1 = names(deg), 
                 V2 = deg,
                 V3 = nchar(names(deg)))
df$V1 <- NULL

df <- df[!duplicated(df),]

p <- plot_ly(data = df, x = ~V2, y = ~V3)  %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Vertex degree"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Vertex length"))
p
```


## Dependency between vertex degree, length and frequency of occurrence 

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(plotly)
df <- data.frame(V1 = names(deg), 
                 V2 = deg,
                 V3 = nchar(names(deg)))
m <- with(df, table(V2, V3))
m <- data.frame(m)  
m$V2 <- as.numeric(as.character(m$V2)) 
m$V3 <- as.numeric(as.character(m$V3)) 

mNew <- data.frame()
for (i in 0:max(m$V2)) {
  for(j in 0: max(m$V3)){
    row <- c(i,j)
    mNew <- rbind(mNew,row)    
  }
}
names(mNew) <- c("V2", "V3")
m <- merge(mNew, m, all.x = T)
m[is.na(m$Freq), "Freq"] <- 0
m <- reshape2::dcast(m, V2 ~ V3) 
m$V2 <- NULL
m <- as.matrix(m)
m <- t(m)
p <- plot_ly(z = m, type = "heatmap") %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Vertex degree"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Vertex length "),
         annotations = list(yref='paper', xref="paper", y=1.05, x=1.1,
                            text="Frequency", showarrow=F, text = "legendtitle"))
p
```

## Dependency between vertex degree, length and logarithmized frequency 

```{r, message=FALSE}
m <- log10(m+1)

p <- plot_ly(z = m, type = "heatmap") %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Vertex degree"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Vertex length"),
         annotations = list(yref='paper', xref="paper", y=1.05, x=1.1,
                            text="Log - frequency", showarrow=F, text = "legendtitle") )
p
```



## Excercise 1 

Is that possible to put more dots on the red line?

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(V1 = names(deg), 
                 V2 = deg,
                 V3 = nchar(names(deg)))
df$V1 <- NULL

df <- df[!duplicated(df),]

p <- plot_ly(data = df, x = ~V2, y = ~V3)  %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Vertex degree"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Vertex length"),
         shapes = list(type = "rect",
                    fillcolor = "red", line = list(color = "red"), opacity = 0.3,
                    x0 = 0, x1 = 46, xref = "x",
                    y0 = 1, y1 = 1, yref = "y"))
p 
```


## Excercise 1 - solution

**No.** One-letter words form polygon. All the vertices are connected together with sides and diagonals. Each vertex degree is the same.


```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


p <- plot_ly(data = df, x = ~V2, y = ~V3)  %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Vertex degree"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Vertex length"),
         shapes = list(type = "rect",
                    fillcolor = "red", line = list(color = "red"), opacity = 0.3,
                    x0 = 0, x1 = 46, xref = "x",
                    y0 = 1, y1 = 1, yref = "y"))
p 
```


## Alternation graph closeness centrality

Vertices with the highest closeness:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
clo <- closeness(net, mode="all")
clo <- clo[order(clo, decreasing = T)]
head(clo)
```

Vertices with the lowest closeness:

```{r}
tail(clo)
```


## The 'belten' word neighborhood (highest closeness vertex)

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(visNetwork)
# find further neighbors
word <- names(head(clo, 1))
node <- match(word, V(net)$name)

neighbors <- neighborhood(graph = net, nodes = node)[[1]]
subNet <- induced_subgraph(graph = net,
                           vids = neighbors,
                           impl =  "copy_and_delete" )
subNet <- toVisNetworkData(igraph = subNet, idToLabel = TRUE)

visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 
```



## Alternation graph betweenness closeness

Vertices with the highest betweenness:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bet <- betweenness(net, normalized = FALSE)
bet <- bet[order(bet, decreasing = T)]
head(bet)
```

Vertices with the lowest betweenness:

```{r}
tail(bet)
```


## The 'booten' word neighborhood (highest betweenness vertex)

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(visNetwork)
# find further neighbors
word <- names(head(bet, 1))
node <- match(word, V(net)$name)

neighbors <- neighborhood(graph = net, nodes = node)[[1]]
subNet <- induced_subgraph(graph = net,
                           vids = neighbors,
                           impl =  "copy_and_delete" )
subNet <- toVisNetworkData(igraph = subNet, idToLabel = TRUE)

visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 
```



## Excercise 2

What is wrong with the 'booten' - graph and how to fix it?

```{r, warning=FALSE}
visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 
```



## Excercise 2 - solution

```{r}
library(visNetwork)
# find further neighbors
word <- names(head(bet, 1))
node <- match(word, V(net)$name)

neighbors <- neighborhood(graph = net, nodes = node)[[1]]
subNet <- induced_subgraph(graph = net,
                           vids = neighbors,
                           impl =  "copy_and_delete" )
newWord <- c("blotee", "boonee", "blonen")
subNet <- subNet + vertices(newWord)

subNet <- subNet + edges(match(newWord[1], V(subNet)$name),
                        match("bloten", V(subNet)$name),
                        match(newWord[1], V(subNet)$name),
                        match("bootee", V(subNet)$name),
                        match(newWord[2], V(subNet)$name),
                        match("boonen", V(subNet)$name),
                        match(newWord[2], V(subNet)$name),
                        match("bootee", V(subNet)$name),
                        match(newWord[3], V(subNet)$name),
                        match("boonen", V(subNet)$name),
                        match(newWord[3], V(subNet)$name),
                        match("bloten", V(subNet)$name))

#subNet <- subNet + edge(match(newWord[1], V(subNet)$name),
#                        match("bootee", V(subNet)$name))

subNet <- toVisNetworkData(igraph = subNet, idToLabel = TRUE)
node <- match(newWord, subNet$nodes[,"label"])
subNet$nodes[node,"color"] <- "red"

visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 
```


## The farthest alternation graph vertices

```{r}
farVert <- farthest_vertices(net)
```

The farthest vertices are **`r names(farVert$vertices[[1]])`** and **`r names(farVert$vertices[[2]])`**. Their distance is equal to: **`r farVert$distance[[1]]`**

The shortest path between the farthest vertices:

```{r}
farPath <- shortest_paths(graph = net,
                 from = farVert$vertices[[1]],
                 to = farVert$vertices[[2]])

farMat <- get.vertex.attribute(net, "name")[farPath$vpath[[1]]]
farMat <- c(farMat, rep(" ", times = 5))

farMat <- matrix(data = farMat, ncol = 7, byrow = TRUE)

knitr::kable(farMat)
```




## The shortest path between the farthest vertices


```{r}

subNet <- induced_subgraph(graph = net,
                              vids = farPath$vpath[[1]],
                              impl =  'create_from_scratch' )
subNet <- toVisNetworkData(igraph = subNet, idToLabel = TRUE)

visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 
```


## The largest alternation graph clique


```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cli <- largest_cliques(net)[[1]]
vid <- as.integer(cli) 

subNet <- induced_subgraph(graph = net,
                           vids = vid,
                           impl =  "copy_and_delete" )
subNet <- toVisNetworkData(igraph = subNet, idToLabel = TRUE)

visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 
```


## The shortest alternation graph circle

```{r}
gir <- girth(net, circle = TRUE)$circle
vid <- as.integer(gir)
subNet <- induced_subgraph(graph = net,
                           vids = vid,
                           impl =  "copy_and_delete" )
subNet <- toVisNetworkData(igraph = subNet, idToLabel = TRUE)

visNetwork(nodes = subNet$nodes,
           edges = subNet$edges) %>%
  visPhysics(solver = "repulsion") 

```
